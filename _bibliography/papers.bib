abstract = {Abstract Photonic crystal line-defect waveguides featuring bandgap confined low loss waveguiding are hindered by high bending losses. Although vortex-mediated topological modes can facilitate seamless propagation through sharp bends, studies of topological transport have primarily focused on interfacial waveguides. In this work, we unveil the prevalence of topological modes across diverse photonic crystal platforms by experimentally demonstrating topological transport in line-defect waveguides. Furthermore, this is achieved by employing interfacial waveguides as mode convertors to selectively excite latent topological states. Topological mode signatures, such as counterpropagating waves, are utilized to establish the existence of topological transport in line-defect waveguides designed using translational unit cells whose electromagnetic eigenstates exhibit phase vortices and non-zero Berry curvatures. It is envisioned that extending topological photonics beyond interfacial systems unlocks new avenues in applications ranging from non-Hermitian topological photonics to topological light-matter interactions.},

    abstract = {On-chip terahertz (THz) biosensors have enormous potential in advancing the development of integrable devices for real-time, label-free, and noninvasive detection of proteins, DNA, and cancerous tissue. However, high absorption of THz waves by water necessitates evanescent field-based biosensing. The conventional on-chip THz biosensors with small mode confinement volumes and scaling sensitivity to defects severely limit the interaction of analyte with the electromagnetic field. Here, we reveal a topological waveguide cavity system with topologically protected propagating interfacial modes, exhibiting evanescent waves with an out-of-plane field extent of     0.3 λ  0, where     λ  0 is the wavelength corresponding to the cavity resonance frequency. Our experiments involving biomolecule detection and leaf-hydration monitoring show that the near-field of high-Q topological cavity resonances accurately detects minute frequency shifts over extended periods, facilitating real-time sensing and monitoring of biological matter. Implementation of topologically protected evanescent fields in waveguide-cavity systems will enhance on-chip THz biosensing.},
