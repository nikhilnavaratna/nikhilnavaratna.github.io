Welcome! I am a final year graduate student at [TeraX Labs](https://web.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ranjans/index.html). My research is centered around these three questions.

- **How can light be confined and guided in silicon waveguides?**  
 Photonics with low-loss and low-dispersion enables high speed chip-to-chip data transfer. Utilizing the novel concepts of topological physics in topological photonic systems can open new avenues for dispersion engineering and chip-miniaturization.

- **How can electronic circuits be optimized to operate efficiently at sub-terahertz frequencies?**  
  The performance of electronic circuits is limited at frequencies close to 300 GHz. Optimising circuit-layouts and passives can mitigate the losses facilitating the development of sub-terahertz electronic circuitry. 

- **How do we effectively characterize the performance of high-frequency photonic and electronic devices?**  
  Sub-terahertz frequencies offer high bandwidth and the opportunity for co-integration of photonics and electronics. Developing communication testbeds operational at these frequencies is vital for benchmarking devices to experimentally validate and benchmark such devices, supporting research into 6G technologies and high-throughput data links
