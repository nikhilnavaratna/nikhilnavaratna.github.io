Welcome! I’m a final-year Ph.D. student at [TeraX Labs](https://web.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ranjans/index.html), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working under the supervision of [Prof. Ranjan Singh](https://web.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~ranjans/prof.html). My research lies at the intersection of terahertz photonics, high-frequency electronics, and communication testbed development where I explore how fundamental principles of physics and engineering can be harnessed to enable next-generation 6G networks and ultra-high-speed data links.

I hold a B.E. (Hons.) in Electronics and Communication and an M.Sc. (Hons.) in Physics from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. As an undergraduate, I conducted research in plasmonics under the guidance of [Prof. Kannan Ramaswamy](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/kannan-ramaswamy/). In my final year, I interned at Texas Instruments, Bangalore, where I worked on jitter characterization in digital circuits.

I completed my Master’s thesis at TIFR Hyderabad under the supervision of [Prof. M. Krishnamurthy](https://www.tifr.res.in/~uphill/), where I continued as a Junior Research Fellow before beginning my doctoral studies.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading both non-fiction and science fiction, with a particular interest in technology, economics, and the history and philosophy of science. I’m also an avid runner and am currently training toward completing half marathons.
