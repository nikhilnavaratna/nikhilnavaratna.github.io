My research is centered around these three questions.

- **How can light be confined and guided in silicon waveguides?**  
 Photonic platforms with low-loss and low-dispersion enable high speed chip-to-chip data transfer and efficient light-matter interaction. Utilizing the novel concepts of topological physics in topological photonic devices can open new avenues for dispersion engineering and chip-miniaturization with promising applications in high-throughput waveguiding, sensing, and spectroscopy. 

- **How can electronic circuits be optimized to operate effectively at high frequencies?**  
  The performance of electronic circuits is limited at frequencies close to 300 GHz. Optimising circuit-layouts and passives can mitigate the losses facilitating the development of high frequency electronic circuitry. 

- **How do we effectively characterize the performance of high-frequency photonic and electronic devices?**  
  Sub-terahertz (0.1 THz - 1 THz) frequencies offer high bandwidth and the opportunity for co-integration of photonics and electronics. Developing communication testbeds operational at these frequencies is vital for benchmarking devices, supporting research into 6G technologies and high-throughput data links.
